Need to know : 
When setting up a phishing campaign for ethical hacking, penetration testing, or security awareness training, itâ€™s crucial to configure your Virtual Private Server (VPS) properly to prevent email spoofing. Email spoofing can cause your emails to be flagged as spam or outright blocked. <br/>
